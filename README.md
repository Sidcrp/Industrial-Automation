Industrial Automation 
The project involves the automation of a pick-and-place system integrated with a conveyor, coupled with barcode reading capabilities for efficient quality control. The core of the automation is driven by Programmable Logic Controller (PLC) programming, specifically on the Allen Bradley 5000 platform.

In this automated system, a robotic arm is tasked with picking objects from a specified location and placing them onto a conveyor. As each object moves along the conveyor, a barcode reader is employed to scan and decode the barcode information. The PLC, programmed on the Allen Bradley 5000, interprets this data and makes real-time decisions based on predetermined criteria.

The PLC programming serves a dual purpose: first, it facilitates the synchronized coordination of the pick-and-place mechanism, ensuring precise and efficient handling of objects. Second, it acts as the brain of the system, executing logic to determine whether the scanned barcode meets acceptance criteria. If the barcode information aligns with predefined parameters, the PLC allows the object to proceed along the conveyor. Conversely, if the barcode indicates a need for rejection, the PLC triggers the necessary mechanism to divert or reject the object from the conveyor line.

This project showcases the seamless integration of robotics, conveyor systems, and PLC programming, demonstrating the power of automation in enhancing both efficiency and accuracy in industrial processes. The Allen Bradley 5000 platform, known for its robustness and versatility, serves as the backbone for the intelligent decision-making process, contributing to a streamlined and reliable automated workflow.  
The Project Includes the following steps
Develop a Main Routine
Develop the Main Routine for your project using the provided project template as your foundation
Develop a reset subroutine
Develop a reset subroutine that will systematically position the workstation to a predefined Home state.

Step 1 - Define individual steps that will choreograph the automation components to a predetermined position and ensure no unintended interaction between the automation components during the positioning movements.
Example list of steps to reset workstation:
Turn off all tower indicator lamps Blink amber tower indicator to signal system resetting Turn off vacuum Retract box ejector Retract vacuum head Rotate vacuum head clockwise Raise vacuum head Position vacuum head at box magazine Rotate vacuum head counterclockwise Set Home flag Turn off amber indicator & turn on green tower indicator to signal system ready.

Step 2 – Develop a logic algorithm for each defined step in your reset routine. In this case, an algorithm is simply a text-based procedure (written definition) for the logical solution for each step.

Step 3 – Develop ladder logic that will satisfy each individual logic algorithm defined for your reset routine. Transition the logic developed in your algorithm to ladder logic. This step can be completed on paper or starting a new project in Studio 5000. If using Studio 5000, remember to open your template file and rename the project Lab 6.

Step 4 – Before “testing” your newly created logic, employ a strategy to force your logic to completely resolve one step before proceeding to the next. This strategy will ensure no unintended interaction between automation components during the positioning movements. One simple method of accomplishing this action is to employ a logical flag or “step” bit to condition the rung under investigation.

Step 5 – Consider employing a diagnostic methodology in your logic to allow you to operate your ladder logic one rung or step at a time. Similar to using logical step bits, diagnostic “test” bits allow you to manipulate the logic scan in order to analyze each rung or step individually and make corrections as needed. Once you are satisfied with your rung by rung diagnostic logic test, you can simply activate all test bits used in the routine to reactivate the normal logical scan sequence. This will then allow you to analyze the entire logical sequence as a logical routine within your program. Once you are satisfied with the logical sequence created, simply delete the test bits before deploying the routine for production.

Step 6 – One other consideration is to employ delay timers in your logic to smooth component movement and interactions. Integrating one quarter or one half second delays between component movements will give your logic a smooth, polished look when operating.
Develop a production subroutine
Develop a production routine that will systematically control the workstation through a single production sequence.
Step 1 - Define individual steps that will constitute a production cycle.
Example list of steps for the production subroutine:
Eject box & hold in position Transfer box to conveyor steps Verify box ejected Lower vacuum head Start vacuum Extend vacuum head Capture box Raise vacuum head Retract vacuum head Rotate vacuum head CW Transfer vacuum head to conveyor Extend vacuum head Disable vacuum – time delay done Start conveyor Stop conveyor when box passes exit proximity sensor.

Step 2 – Develop a logic algorithm for your production routine. In this case, an algorithm is simply a text-based procedure (written definition) for the logical sequence of steps that constitute a production cycle.

Step 3 – Develop ladder logic that will satisfy your logic algorithm. Transition the logic developed in your algorithm to ladder logic. This step can be completed on paper or editing your Lab6-Home project using Studio 5000. If using Studio 5000, remember to open your Lab6-Home project file and rename the project Lab 7.
Step 4 – Before “testing” your newly created logic, employ a strategy to force your logic to completely resolve one step before proceeding to the next. This strategy will ensure no unintended interaction between automation components during the positioning movements.
